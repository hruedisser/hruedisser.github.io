During my work at the <a href="https://www.know-center.at/en/" target="_blank">Know Center</a>, I contributed to various use cases for **Time Series Event Detection** within the <a href="https://www.europlanet-society.org/europlanet-2024-ri/machine-learning/" target="_blank">Europlanet 2024 RI</a> project:

- Automatic Detection of Interplanetary Coronal Mass Ejections in Solar Wind In Situ Data
- Automatic Detection of Magnetospheric Boundaries

In addition to a first-author publication {% cite 2022SpWea..2003149R %} and several conference contribution, this work also served as the basis of my master's thesis.

The main approach is based on **supervised machine learning** and has been successfully applied to different datasets, such as **Wind, STEREO-A or STEREO-B.**

<h2>ARCANE</h2>

Based on previous work, I am currently working on the improvement of the **ARCANE** (**A**utomatic **R**ealtime dete**C**tion **AN**d for**E**cast) framework and integrating it into the **real-time prediction pipeline** at the <a href="https://helioforecast.space/" target="_blank">Austrian Space Weather Office</a>. ARCANE will serve as a real time monitor and contribute to automated operational forecasting. In collaboration with **Gautier Nguyen** at <a href="https://www.onera.fr/en" target="_blank">ONERA - The French Aerospace Lab</a>, we are advancing the use of this methodology for **early detection** of ICMEs and **prediction of key parameters**.

This work is part of my PhD project, titled **Combining AI and Physical Models to Advance Forecasting of Solar Coronal Mass Ejections**, under the ERC project 
<a href="https://helioforecast.space/erc_helio4cast" target="_blank">HELIO4CAST</a>, which attempts to solve the **Bz problem** in heliospheric space weather forecasting.
